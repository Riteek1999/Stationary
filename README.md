# Stationary


###Introduction

As you know, e-commerce websites are generally used for selling electronic gadgets and clothing products.To break this trend, I have brought a new concept of selling stationary products.
I have put in lots of efforts to give my website a quite good user interface. As stationary products are very cheap, this website provides the sale of products in bulk rather than selling it in smaller quantities,which can be a drawback to such websites.
